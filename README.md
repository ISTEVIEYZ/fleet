Game written in Go using the Oak framework.

### Requirements

+ [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep): Run `go get -u github.com/golang/dep/cmd/dep` in your terminal.

### Build

+ Run `dep ensure` to get all the packages needed for the project (you should have a "vendor" folder once it's done).
+ Either run `go run main.go` or `go build` and then run the executable that Go creates.
